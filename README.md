# System requirements
## Hardware Requirements
- 128 Gb RAM
- GPU with 12Gb VRAM
Requirements may be lowered for minimal testing enviroments.

## Software Requirements

The exact minimal requirement are not known exactly. However, the implementation uses standard routines and very few dependencies, therefore old version may still perform adequately. The experiment has been performed with the following software versions:

- python 3.6.8
- numpy 1.19.5
- scipy 1.5.4
- torch 1.10 with CUDA 11.3 and cudnn 8.2
